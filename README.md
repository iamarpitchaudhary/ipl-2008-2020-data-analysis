> **IPL-2008-2020-data-analysis**
> This GitHub repository showcases a comprehensive data analysis of IPL (Indian Premier League) data spanning from 2008 to 2020. The data was initially obtained from Kaggle and subsequently imported into MS Excel for further analysis. The first step involved performing data cleansing to ensure the data was accurate, consistent, and free from any errors or anomalies.

Once the data was cleaned, the next stage was to apply conditional formatting to highlight important trends, patterns, and outliers within the dataset. The use of conditional formatting improved the readability and allowed for quick identification of key insights.

To facilitate data exploration and gain deeper insights, pivot tables and pivot table graphical representations were employed. These powerful Excel features provided an interactive way to slice and dice the data, enabling the creation of various visualizations like charts, graphs, and summary tables.

After successfully creating informative and visually appealing visualizations, a dashboard was designed to present the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) derived from the IPL data. The dashboard included multiple visual elements that offered a holistic view of the IPL trends and performance over the years. Additionally, slicers were implemented to allow users to interactively filter and explore the data in the dashboard.

To share the findings and results with a broader audience, the visualizations were copied into MS PowerPoint, where presentation slides were created. Each slide in the presentation showcased different aspects of the IPL data analysis, such as overall performance trends, team-specific insights, player statistics, and notable match moments.

The GitHub repository contains all the relevant files and code used for data cleaning, data analysis, visualization creation, and dashboard development. The README.md file serves as a guide for users, explaining the contents and the steps involved in the data analysis process. The repository enables others to replicate the analysis, explore the visualizations, and gain valuable insights from the IPL data.

Overall, this GitHub repository demonstrates a comprehensive and well-organized approach to analyzing IPL data, making it a valuable resource for anyone interested in cricket analytics or data analysis using MS Excel and PowerPoint.
